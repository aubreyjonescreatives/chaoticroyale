## Chaotic Neutral Games
### Team project for DGM 3780 Spring 2021
---

## Description

This project is a simple casino-style gaming app that uses the React library and the [Deck of Cards API](http://deckofcardsapi.com/).

Initially, this app will consist of a single game - Blackjack - and, if we have time we'll add more.

## Framework

We chose the [React](https://reactjs.org) library because React has a higher demand in the job market and we wanted something that would demonstrate our skills with the library and also give us some practice.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:  `git clone git@github.com:aubreyjonescreatives/chaotcneutralgames.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd chaotcneutralgames`
3. Install NPM packages: `npm i`
4. Run development server: `npm start`
5. Build for production: `npm run build`

## Notes:

- This Card Deck API does not require an api key.

- There are not many commits here because I had to move files around on my computer 

- You will need to change the CRUD paths to access your localhost if you do not connect this to a database 

- add a .env file to import your .env PORT 

- I am still working on overall functionality so that I can deploy this app while combining back end to front end
